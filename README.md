📘 Alfido Tech Internship – Python Projects

This repository contains the four major Python tasks completed during my Alfido Tech Internship.
Each task demonstrates programming logic, problem-solving, and clean code practices.

📂 Tasks Overview
✅ Task 1: Basic Calculator

A simple Python program that performs:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

The program takes two numbers as input and performs the selected arithmetic operation.

📌 Skills: Input handling, conditional statements, basic arithmetic.

✅ Task 2: Number Guessing Game

A fun interactive game where:

The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100

The user must guess the number

Program gives hints:

Too High

Too Low

Shows total attempts after correct guess

📌 Skills: Loops, random module, input validation, logic building.

✅ Task 3: Temperature Converter

A command-line temperature converter supporting:

From	To
Celsius	Fahrenheit
Celsius	Kelvin
Fahrenheit	Celsius
Fahrenheit	Kelvin
Kelvin	Celsius
Kelvin	Fahrenheit

📌 Skills: Mathematical formulas, functions, condition handling, modular code.

✅ Task 4: Simple To-Do List App

A command-line To-Do List application with:

Add a task

Remove a task

View all tasks

Exit

Tasks are stored in memory during runtime and updated dynamically.

📌 Skills: Lists, loops, functions, menu-driven programs, input validation.
